The origin of this project is https://github.com/zionyx/jenkins-tray. This project is a Rust port of the original C# project.
The user interface is build with Slint [Slint](https://slint.rs/).

## About

This template helps you get started developing a Rust application with Slint as toolkit
for the user interface. It demonstrates the integration between the `.slint` UI markup and
Rust code, how to react to callbacks, get and set properties, and use basic widgets.

## Usage

1. Install Rust by following its [getting-started guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
   Once this is done, you should have the `rustc` compiler and the `cargo` build system installed in your `PATH`.
2. Clone this repository into your workspace.
3. Change the working directory and build the application:
    ```
    cd jenkins_tray_rs    
    ```
4. Build with `cargo`:
    ```
    cargo build 
    ```
5. Run the application binary:
    ```
    cargo run
    ```

We recommend using an IDE for development, along with our [LSP-based IDE integration for `.slint` files](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/blob/master/tools/lsp/README.md). You can also load this project directly in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and install our [Slint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Slint.slint).
